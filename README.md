# Chirp ECS Game Engine

This is a 2D game engine project with the Entity Component System (ECS) architecture.
The project is incomplete, but does feature a working implementation of ECS ideas. 
I worked on this project in 2018 before starting my PhD in discrete differential geometry.
See my profile to find more relevant (and completed!) computational geometry projects I either pursued for fun or for my research.
