FEATURES:
* Terrain generation.
* Messaging/event system.
* Cameras with view matrices.
* Projections with projection matrices.



OPTIMIZATIONS:
* Transformation matrices do not need to be made every frame.
  Make them once and store them in the Transform component.
  This will take up more memory, but creating a matrix for every component
  every single frame is probably a bigger issue.



IMPROVEMENTS:
* Input system sucks, but it might just be my keyboard.
  When first holding down a key, it takes a second for the "holding down" part
  to kick in, so moving a triangle with inputs feels sluggish.
  Diagonal movement also does not work right now.
